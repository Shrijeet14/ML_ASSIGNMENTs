    "<h6>A) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of computer systems and algorithms that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and perception. AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI (or Weak AI) and General AI (or Strong AI). Narrow AI is designed for a specific task, while General AI aims to possess human-like intelligence across a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A popular example of AI is virtual personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. These AI-driven applications can understand and respond to natural language voice commands, answer questions, set reminders, and perform various tasks, all by simulating human-like intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML allows machines to learn from patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Spam email filtering is a classic example of machine learning. ML algorithms can analyze a large dataset of emails and learn to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails based on patterns in the content, sender information, and other features. As more data is processed, the algorithm becomes better at identifying and filtering out spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Deep Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It involves the use of artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons). Deep Learning excels at tasks like image and speech recognition and has revolutionized many AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model often used in image recognition tasks. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, CNNs can process real-time video data from cameras and identify objects, lane markings, and traffic signs. Deep learning has also been used extensively in natural language processing, where models like GPT-3 can generate human-like text based on input prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of creating machines that can mimic human intelligence, Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on learning from data, and Deep Learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to excel in specific tasks such as image and speech recognition.</h6>"
